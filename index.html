					<h2>Learning to Drive</h2>
					<p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Back in 1997 when I was a senior at Bensalem High School I figured out that if I learned to drive and drove myself to school instead of taking the bus I could sleep 20 minutes later. My Dad was willing to help me learn, but both cars my parents owned were stick shift.  Mom was driving a Mazda B2000, which is a short bed small pickup truck. My Dad was driving a small Isuzu extended cab pickup truck.</p> 

                 <p id="testP" class="funParagraph"> I did my best to try and learn stick, but found it very frustrating. I distinctly remember stalling multiple times trying to cross a busy road on a slight hill. I got frustrated and said I was not driving anymore. Trying to force me to keep trying my Dad said he wasn’t driving the truck. I told him that he would be sitting in the truck alone then. I put the truck in park, pulled the e-break, and got out to start walking home. Not long after this incident I decided to try to buy an automatic car.

					<h2>Buying My First Car</h2>
					<p>My Mom had a hair shop in Tacony;  one time I was visiting her for a haircut and I spotted a small white car for sale.  With my Dad's help I contacted the owner and arranged to take it for a quick test drive. The car had a Virginia title, New Jersey Inspection, Pennsylvania tags, and was being sold by a friend of the owner becase the owner was in jail. Before I could test drive the car the owner removed rear triangle window and placed in the back seat becase it wasn't attached to the car anymore, and the power steering did not work. I bought the car, a 1986 Ford Escort, for $350. I paid for about $1000 worth of rapairs to the car and happily drove it for a little more than a year.  I sold it to an ex-boyfriend for $750.

					<h2>Driving a Classic Car</h2>
					<p>While I was driving the Escort on the regular I did get an opportunity to drive my Mom’s 1966 Ford Mustang Fastback.  This was one of her first cars and it had been parked in storage for many years. My parents have recently restored the Mustang to its former glory, as seen in the photo.  The Mustang was terrifying to drive as a still new driver. It has a lot of power and no power steering so you have to actually steer to keep it on the road, no passive driving like with more modern cars. I look forward to driving the Mustang again now that I’m older and more experienced.

					<h2>Almost Cool</h2>
					<p>Once I sold the Escort I bought a red 1988 Chrysler LeBaron convertible.  This was my college car.  I cut my hair short to keep it out of my eyes and drove around with the top down as often as possible.  Funny thing about LeBaron’s is that they are <em>almost cool</em>, but not really. I would cram more people than was safe into the car and drive to Denny's for late night nonsense. I have a vivid memory of driving down I-95 with the top down and my passenger held a gummy snake out the top to see how much it would stretch in the wind. College was a time for a lot of <em>NOT</em> wise choices.

					<h2>Cruising in my Cadillac</h2>
					<p>While I was in college my brother joined the Air Force and got married. At the time my brother was driving a 90’s Camaro and his wife needed a car. My Grandfather had recently bought my Grandmother a 1986 Cadillac Eldorado, she did not want this car becase she "Only drives Oldsmobiles". I decided as a wedding gift I would give my brother and his new wife my LeBaron and buy my Grandomom’s Cadillac for myself.  I bought the car and drove that beast for the rest of college and <b>LOVED</b> it.

					<h2>A Brand New Car!</h2>
					<p>As it goes with old cars the Cadillac started to have mechanical problems and was becoming less reliable, and Cadillacs are expensive to repair. One day when I was picking up my brother to go get haircuts the car wouldn’t start, I got frustrated and had him drive me to Hyundai. I was going to buy a brand new car to stop having the used car problems I had been dealing with.</p>   

                 <p>I walked into Hyundai and said I wanted an Accent, as that was the cheapest car they made at the time. I said no white, red, or black cars and I needed power locks and windows.  The dealership didn’t have an Accent that met my needs, but they did have a base model Elantra that they would sell to me for the cost of an Accent with the power lock and window upgrade.  That day I drove away in my brand new 2004 Hyundai Elantra.  I promised myself I would drive it into the ground, I owned that car until it died in June 2020.

					<h2>A Second Car for my Family</h2>					
                 <p>Over the years of owning the Elantra I got married and had a kid.  We needed a second car for daycare pickup and errands while I had the Elantra with me at work.  My husband commuted to work by bike or train so we never needed a second car before. My Mom was terrified of my husband doing daycare pickup on my late nights with his bike and a baby trailer so she gave us her old Hyundai Santa Fe in 2015. We used it as our backup car for when I had the Elantra at work until the Santa Fe timing belt went in 2017.

					<h2>Hello Hybrid</h2>					
                 <p>We had gotten used to having 2 cars and needed to be able to get the kid around. I had my heart set on a hybrid and I managed to find an affordable used Prius C.  We bought it in 2017 and I am still driving this car today.  We relegated the aging Elantra to be the backup car and I started driving the Prius daily. I especially enjoy having a car that gets an average of 42mpg with gas prices being where they are lately.  It’s also really great for finding parking when I visit friends in Fishtown, West Philly, and South Philly becase it is so small.  I will very likely drive this until it dies. </p>

					<h2>I've always wanted a Jetta</h2>					
                 <p>When the Elantra died in 2020 we again started the hunt for a second car.  Car shopping during the early stages of COVID-19 was not an enjoyable experience.  We looked a lot online and visited a few used car shops and eventually settled on a used Volkswagen Jetta.  This is now our long trip/ highway car as it gets better highway mileage than the Prius.  We will also likely drive this until it dies, it’s a fun car to have.</p>
					<p>My husband and I have both decided that when the time comes to buy a new car it will very likely be an electric vehicle. I have no idea what kind of car it will be since new advances are happening very fast with electric vehicles and more research into what we want will happen when we are closer to actually buying one. I secretly want the new electric Mustang but can't currently justify getting one and am hoping that by the time I do need one they will have a coupe version. </p>
